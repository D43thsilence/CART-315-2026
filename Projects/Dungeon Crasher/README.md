# Dungeon Crasher

In this game, you play as a knight that must defeat as many enemies as possible in a dungeon. They spawn far away from eachother but you can use your overwhelming speed to quickly close any gap! But it seems like there are many obstacles in your way...

To launch the game, load the folder in an IDE and open the game on a browser through a local web server (using the "Go Live" function through the "Live Server" add-on through Visual Studio Code for example). Have fun!
